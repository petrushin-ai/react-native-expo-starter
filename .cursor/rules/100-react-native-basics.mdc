### General rules

- Always try to fit in conventional architecture, if it's possible do not create additional files
- If file length exceeding 500 lines consider refactoring it to some helpers \ hooks or anyhow reasonable
- Create usefull universall functional-style helpers, and if you need new always check against existing ones
- Carefully consider fixing all typescript and linter errors as it guarantees app starts
- Follow architectural patterns where it's possible and needed, but consider size of project every time
- Use Sequential thinking MCP to analyze task and implement action plan sequentially


### Do's and DONT's

Never write documentation or tests unless explicitly asked

Do not ever try to run the project, it's user's duty

Use web search and docs to understand which is the best native implementation option and develop own implementation if there's nothing found in docs or web
